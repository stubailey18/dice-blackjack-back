# Dice Blackjack (Back)

The is the Java (Spring Boot) back-end of a version of Blackjack played with dice. It's a web socket server that handles clients playing the game. Each message (join, hit, stand, etc.) results in the sending of updated game data back to the clients for re-rendering.

You can see the app in action [here](https://stubailey18.com/dice-blackjack). Note that the app uses popups. The code for the front-end part of the app is accessible [here](https://github.com/stubailey18/dice-blackjack-front).
